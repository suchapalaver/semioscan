//! Error types for block window calculations.
//!
//! This module provides error types for operations in the `blocks` module,
//! particularly for calculating daily block windows.

/// Errors that can occur during block window calculations.
///
/// This error type covers validation errors, RPC failures, cache I/O errors,

/// for specific dates on various chains.

/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust,ignore
/// use semioscan::{BlockWindowCalculator, BlockWindowError};
/// use alloy_chains::NamedChain;
/// use chrono::NaiveDate;
///
/// async fn example() -> Result<(), BlockWindowError> {

///
///     match calculator.get_daily_window(NamedChain::Arbitrum, date).await {
///         Ok(window) => println!("Success: {:?}", window),
