//! Shared RPC error types for blockchain provider operations.
//!
//! This module provides error types for common RPC failures that can occur
//! when interacting with blockchain providers.
//!
//! # When RPC Errors Occur
//!
//! RPC errors typically occur due to:
//! - **Network issues**: Connectivity problems, timeouts, or DNS failures
//! - **Rate limiting**: Provider has throttled your requests
//! - **Invalid parameters**: Block number out of range, invalid transaction hash
//! - **Provider issues**: Node is down, syncing, or experiencing problems
//! - **Chain reorganizations**: Requested block was reorged
//!
//! # Handling RPC Errors
//!
//! RPC errors include context about what operation was being performed to help
//! with debugging and retry logic:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use semioscan::{GasCostCalculator, GasCalculationError, RpcError};
//!
//! match calculator.calculate_gas_cost(...).await {
//!     Ok(result) => println!("Success: {:?}", result),
//!     Err(GasCalculationError::Rpc(RpcError::BlockNotFound { block_number })) => {
//!         eprintln!("Block {block_number} not found - may be beyond chain tip");
//!     }
//!     Err(GasCalculationError::Rpc(RpcError::RequestFailed { operation, .. })) => {
//!         eprintln!("RPC request failed during {operation} - retrying...");
//!     }
//!     Err(e) => eprintln!("Other error: {e}"),
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! # Accessing Underlying Provider Errors
//!
//! Several variants preserve the underlying provider error in their `source` field.
//! Access it using the standard `Error::source()` method:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use std::error::Error;
//!
//! if let Err(e) = calculator.calculate_gas_cost(...).await {
//!     eprintln!("Error: {e}");
//!
//!     // Walk the error chain
//!     let mut source = e.source();
//!     while let Some(err) = source {
//!         eprintln!("  Caused by: {err}");
//!         source = err.source();
//!     }
//! }
//! ```

/// Errors that can occur during blockchain RPC operations.
///
/// This error type captures common failure modes when interacting with
/// blockchain providers (e.g., via Alloy). It includes context about what
/// operation was being performed to aid in debugging.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```rust
/// use semioscan::RpcError;
/// use alloy_primitives::TxHash;
///
/// // Example of creating an RPC error with context
/// let error = RpcError::TransactionNotFound {
///     tx_hash: TxHash::ZERO,
/// };
/// println!("Error: {}", error);
/// ```
///
/// # Stability
///
/// This enum is marked `#[non_exhaustive]`. New variants may be added in
/// future releases without a major-version bump, so downstream `match`
/// arms over `RpcError` from another crate must include a wildcard
/// (`_ => ...`) arm. This mirrors the discipline already applied to the
/// crate's other public configuration types (`RpcConfig`,
/// `ChainEndpoint`) so that adding a new operational error variant does
/// not force every consumer to recompile.
